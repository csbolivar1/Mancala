# Mancala

Mancala is a turn based count and capture board game. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala "Mancala Wiki").

## Objective
The object of the game is to gather more "seeds" in your "store" than your opponent. Each player's store is the large hole to their right side. 
Seeds are gathered by capturing or "sowing" them.


## Gameplay
1. Players begin by placing a minimum number of "seeds" (can consist of small shells, rocks, seeds or other small objects) 
into each players' side 
2. Flip a coin to determine who goes first. 
3. The player then selects one of the holds on their side, gathers the seeds from that hole and distributes
one seed into every hole except for the opponent's store in the large hole on the player's left,
going counter-clockwise until depletion.
4. If the last seed is dropped into a hole, the player picks up all the seeds from that last hole, and begins
distributing again.
5. If the last seed is dropped into the player's own store, the player plays again, and selects a hole
occupied with seeds to distribute again.
6. If the last seed is placed in an empty hole on the player's side, the player takes all seeds in the opposite 
hole, and the one seed on the player's side, and places them in their store. The player's turn ends.
7. If the last seed is placed in an empty hole on the opponent's side, the player's turn ends.
